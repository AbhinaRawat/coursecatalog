This is a full-stack Course Catalog application built using Angular (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), and MongoDB Atlas (database). 
The platform allows users to browse available courses, search and filter by title, category, or instructor, and enroll in courses.
Once enrolled, users can track and update their progress, or unenroll as needed.
The frontend is deployed on Netlify, and the backend API is hosted on Render. The MongoDB database is hosted using MongoDB Atlas, with seeded initial data. 
This project demonstrates real-world full stack architecture with RESTful API integration, responsive design, reactive state management using RxJS, and deployment using cloud servicesâ€”all done without requiring any paid services or credit card. Live project links, credentials (if required), and deployment instructions are included in the repository.
